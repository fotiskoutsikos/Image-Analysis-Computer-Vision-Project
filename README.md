# Image-Analysis-Computer-Vision-Project

This notebook is part of a university course on Image and Video Analysis and presents a structured workflow for analyzing and processing image data using Python and OpenCV.

## Objective

The goal was to construct a custom dataset, extract features, and perform targeted analysis on selected image classes. The project required both theoretical understanding of image processing techniques and practical application through structured experimentation.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV, NumPy
- Google Colab

## Notes

The project reflects a combination of academic requirements and individual implementation decisions. Code quality and structure were prioritized to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
